## Why We Forked create-t3-app
The open-source nature of `create-t3-app` allows it to evolve alongside the needs of the community. Our team saw an opportunity to build upon this amazing foundation by integrating Neon as a database provider. The goal of our fork was not to diverge from the original project but to contribute an enhancement that we hope will eventually be merged back into the main repository.

- The original `create-t3-app` offered PlanetScale as the primary database option for MySQL users. However, with PlanetScale's recent deprecation of their free tier, the community needs a strong alternativeâ€”especially for those who prefer to build on PostgreSQL. Neon, designed for serverless environments and with its very generous free tier, is the perfect fit for this role.

### Why Neon?
Neon offers a modern, serverless PostgreSQL solution that is perfectly aligned with the needs of developers who prioritize performance, scalability, and simplicity. 

With Neon, you get:

- *Serverless PostgreSQL*: Seamless scaling without the need for managing servers.
- *Cost Efficiency*: A free tier that supports developers from prototyping to production.
- *Developer-Friendly*: A modern approach to database management, making it easy to integrate into existing workflows.

### How to Use the CLI Tool
